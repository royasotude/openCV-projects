The first project (lines) demonstrates how to create geometric line art using the OpenCV library in Python. The resulting image is a colorful and intricate pattern of lines forming a visually appealing design.

The second project (circles) showcases the creation of geometric patterns using OpenCV in Python, including a colorful line art design and a series of concentric circles. The images are generated through custom scripts demonstrating the artistic potential of OpenCV's drawing functions.
